# LM3886 Based Stereo Power Amplifier

This is a stereo amplifier built around Texas Instruments' acclaimed LM3886 amplifier integrated circuit chip (one per channel).  

## Power Stage

The power supply for this amplifier is based on the design in Texas Instrument's Application Note [AN-1849](https://www.ti.com/lit/an/snaa057c/snaa057c.pdf). The design has been modified to output 

TE 5-1415899-0.

Components
Capacitors:

WIMA - Excellent film capacitors (MKP, polypropylene) for signal path coupling and tone circuits. Their FKP and MKP series are audio favorites.
Vishay - Wide range including their BC Components line. Good polyester and polypropylene film caps.
Panasonic - Their FC series electrolytics are solid for power supply filtering and coupling where you need high capacitance.
Nichicon - Particularly their "Fine Gold" (FG) and "Muse" series for audio-grade electrolytics.

Resistors:

Vishay - Their metal film resistors are excellent. Look for the Dale series (CMF, RN55) for low noise.
Bourns - Good quality metal film resistors at reasonable prices.
KOA Speer - Reliable metal film resistors with low noise characteristics.
